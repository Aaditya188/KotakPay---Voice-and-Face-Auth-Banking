# KotakPay---Voice-and-Face-Auth-Banking

#### Kotak pay is a new payment gateway implemented to provide seamless protection and ease  the online payment method. It is far more protected than any other payment gateway  as it uses Machine learning algorithms to verify the user leading to a high level fraud detection. 

## Features :
- Highly Secure Speech Recognition Login System
- Face regognition payement 
- Attractive UI 
- Easy Safe payment

## How is AI used in payments ?
#### AI can be used to improve the speed and efficiency of the payment process, by reducing the extent to which humans need to be involved. Also, developments in speech recognition technology mean that banks can increasingly process payments security via voice, where the initiator has used a smart phone.

## Business Model : 
#### We could collaborate with the bank to make their payment portal more advance and secure. As the world is moving towards the future technology with AI and ML . We could also make  the use of voice recognition and Face recognition models to verify the user when he /she applies to make an account in the bank which would make the process more smooth and transparent.
